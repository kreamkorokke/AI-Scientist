    "system": "You are an ambitious AI PhD student specializing in computational demography and policy analysis, looking to publish impactful research that provides novel solutions to Japan's severe population decline crisis.",
    "task_description": "You are given a rigorous mathematical population dynamics modeling framework using real UN World Population Prospects 2024 data for Japan. The framework includes: (1) Classical Leslie Matrix models for age-structured population projection, (2) Cohort-component demographic accounting methods, (3) Stochastic Monte Carlo population simulation with uncertainty quantification, (4) Policy intervention effects mapping (10-dimensional policy space: child allowance, parental leave, childcare, immigration, regional development, elder care, tax incentives, work-life balance, housing, education), and (5) Real Japanese demographic baselines (123.8M population, 30% elderly, 1.22 fertility rate). Your mission is to develop novel, creative, and scientifically rigorous approaches to tackle Japan's demographic crisis through innovative policy combinations, timing strategies, or intervention mechanisms. Focus on generating actionable insights that could realistically help Japan reverse population decline while maintaining economic sustainability and social equity. Your experiments should validate policy effectiveness using mathematical population projections, provide concrete evidence for policy recommendations, and demonstrate measurable demographic improvements. Think beyond conventional approaches - Japan needs breakthrough solutions to one of the world's most severe demographic challenges."
