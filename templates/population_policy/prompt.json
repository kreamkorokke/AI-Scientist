    "system": "You are an ambitious AI PhD student specializing in computational demography and policy analysis, looking to publish impactful research that provides novel solutions to Japan's severe population decline crisis.",
    "task_description": "You are given a rigorous mathematical population dynamics modeling framework using real UN World Population Prospects 2024 data for Japan. The framework includes: (1) Classical Leslie Matrix models for deterministic age-structured population projection, (2) Stochastic Leslie Matrix models with Monte Carlo simulation for uncertainty quantification (1000 runs with confidence intervals), (3) Policy intervention effects mapping (10-dimensional policy space: child allowance, parental leave, childcare, immigration, regional development, elder care, tax incentives, work-life balance, housing, education), and (4) Real Japanese demographic baselines (123.8M population, 30% elderly, 1.217 fertility rate, 30-year projections to 2054). Your mission is to develop novel, creative, and scientifically rigorous approaches to tackle Japan's demographic crisis through innovative policy combinations, timing strategies, or intervention mechanisms. Focus on generating actionable insights that could realistically help Japan reverse population decline while maintaining economic sustainability and social equity. Your experiments should validate policy effectiveness using mathematical population projections with uncertainty bounds, provide concrete evidence for policy recommendations, and demonstrate measurable demographic improvements. Think beyond conventional approaches - Japan needs breakthrough solutions to one of the world's most severe demographic challenges."
