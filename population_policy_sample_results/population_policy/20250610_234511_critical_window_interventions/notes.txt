# Title: Critical Window Analysis for Emergency Demographic Interventions
# Experiment description: Japan faces a rapidly closing window for demographic intervention before population decline becomes irreversible. We use mathematical population models to identify critical intervention windows where policy timing dramatically affects long-term outcomes. We test the hypothesis that 'emergency demographic protocols' implemented within the next 5-10 years could prevent catastrophic population collapse, while delayed interventions (post-2030) may be insufficient regardless of intensity. Using cohort-component projections, we simulate time-sensitive policy sequences (e.g., immediate fertility incentives → targeted immigration → sustained support) and compare early vs. late intervention scenarios. The experiment quantifies the demographic and economic costs of policy delay, providing evidence for urgent vs. gradual response strategies.

## Run 4: Emergency Protocol (Maximum Intervention)
Results: {'baseline_population_decline_pct': -31.991853029760154, 'baseline_aging_ratio_pct': 98.84102588328342, 'baseline_dependency_ratio': 9335.465634358847, 'baseline_policy_effectiveness_pct': 0.0, 'baseline_final_population_millions': 83.72039492379854, 'emergency_protocol_population_decline_pct': -6.391162378997225, 'emergency_protocol_aging_ratio_pct': 93.94844376636473, 'emergency_protocol_dependency_ratio': 1801.951720011125, 'emergency_protocol_policy_effectiveness_pct': 37.643564471717944, 'emergency_protocol_final_population_millions': 115.23573576291551, 'demographic_crisis_severity': 0.9884102588328342}
Description: This run tested the theoretical maximum intervention possible by implementing all policy levers at 100% intensity (1.0) immediately and sustaining them throughout the projection period. This represents the upper bound of what could be achieved with unlimited political will and resources. The results reveal:

1. Maximum Impact: The emergency protocol achieved a dramatic 37.6% improvement over baseline, far exceeding other approaches:
   - Early Intervention (Run 1): 14.9% improvement
   - Delayed Intervention (Run 2): 7.9% improvement
   - Phased Implementation (Run 3): 17.6% improvement

2. Population Preservation: 
   - Limited decline of only -6.4% vs baseline -32.0%
   - Final population of 115.2M vs baseline 83.7M
   - Saved 31.5M people from population decline

3. Structural Improvements:
   - Reduced aging ratio to 93.9% (lowest of all scenarios)
   - Dramatically improved dependency ratio to 1802 (vs baseline 9335)
   - Achieved most balanced demographic structure

4. Theoretical vs Practical:
   - Demonstrates significant theoretical potential for demographic intervention
   - Sets upper bound for policy effectiveness
   - Highlights gap between theoretical maximum and more practical approaches

This run shows that while dramatic improvement is theoretically possible with maximum intervention, even this "emergency protocol" cannot completely prevent population decline (-6.4%). This suggests some degree of demographic change may be inevitable, though its severity can be significantly mitigated through policy intervention.

Description: Baseline results.

## Run 1: Early Intervention (2024-2029)
Results: {'baseline_population_decline_pct': -31.98627981949721, 'baseline_aging_ratio_pct': 98.84385902354666, 'baseline_dependency_ratio': 9358.085270997042, 'baseline_policy_effectiveness_pct': 0.0, 'baseline_final_population_millions': 83.72725573952421, 'early_intervention_population_decline_pct': -21.869103813120734, 'early_intervention_aging_ratio_pct': 97.36841675241958, 'early_intervention_dependency_ratio': 4121.614551376851, 'early_intervention_policy_effectiveness_pct': 14.875198679805093, 'early_intervention_final_population_millions': 96.18185137992694, 'demographic_crisis_severity': 0.9884385902354665}
Description: This run tested an aggressive early intervention strategy with maximum policy intensity (0.8-0.9) across all levers during 2024-2029, followed by moderate sustained support (0.5-0.6) thereafter. The results strongly support the critical window hypothesis:

1. Population Impact: Early intervention reduced population decline from -32% to -21.9%, a 31.6% improvement over baseline
2. Policy Effectiveness: Achieved 14.9% better outcomes than baseline, higher than any single static policy
3. Demographic Structure: Reduced aging ratio to 97.4% (vs 98.8% baseline) and dependency ratio to 4121 (vs 9358 baseline)
4. Final Population: Preserved 96.2M people vs 83.7M in baseline, saving 12.5M from decline

The results demonstrate that early, intense intervention can significantly alter Japan's demographic trajectory, even with reduced intensity after the initial 5-year emergency period. This supports the hypothesis that the timing of intervention is crucial.

## Run 2: Delayed Intervention (2030-2035)
Results: {'baseline_population_decline_pct': -32.03549287222871, 'baseline_aging_ratio_pct': 98.84347682869728, 'baseline_dependency_ratio': 9354.917536817753, 'baseline_policy_effectiveness_pct': 0.0, 'baseline_final_population_millions': 83.66667275948963, 'delayed_intervention_population_decline_pct': -26.644865951440224, 'delayed_intervention_aging_ratio_pct': 97.73175109807582, 'delayed_intervention_dependency_ratio': 4815.108556318895, 'delayed_intervention_policy_effectiveness_pct': 7.9315324256737, 'delayed_intervention_final_population_millions': 90.30272203889085, 'demographic_crisis_severity': 0.9884347682869727}
Description: This run tested the same intervention strategy but delayed until 2030-2035, using identical policy intensities to Run 1 (0.8-0.9 during intervention, 0.5-0.6 sustained support) to enable direct comparison. The results reveal significant costs of delay:

1. Reduced Effectiveness: Delayed intervention achieved only 7.9% improvement vs baseline, compared to 14.9% with early intervention
2. Population Loss: Final population of 90.3M vs 96.2M with early intervention - a difference of 5.9M people lost to delay
3. Worse Demographics: Higher aging ratio (97.7% vs 97.4%) and dependency ratio (4815 vs 4121) compared to early intervention
4. Intervention Timing Impact: The 6-year delay cut policy effectiveness nearly in half, despite using identical policy intensities

This strongly supports the hypothesis that post-2030 interventions may be insufficient to prevent severe demographic decline, even with aggressive policy measures. The results quantify the substantial demographic penalties of delayed action.

## Run 3: Phased Implementation
Results: {'baseline_population_decline_pct': -31.992674278423443, 'baseline_aging_ratio_pct': 98.84303193711212, 'baseline_dependency_ratio': 9351.472663082557, 'baseline_policy_effectiveness_pct': 0.0, 'baseline_final_population_millions': 83.71938393812279, 'phased_implementation_population_decline_pct': -20.031702109020898, 'phased_implementation_aging_ratio_pct': 96.131631695776, 'phased_implementation_dependency_ratio': 2832.8961917093848, 'phased_implementation_policy_effectiveness_pct': 17.587770203420465, 'phased_implementation_final_population_millions': 98.44375680087913, 'demographic_crisis_severity': 0.9884303193711211}
Description: This run tested a carefully sequenced rollout of interventions:

Phase 1 (2024-2026): Focused on fertility support
- Maximum intensity (0.9) for child allowances, parental leave, and childcare
- Minimal changes to other policies
- Goal: Build institutional capacity and public trust with focused initiatives

Phase 2 (2027-2029): Added immigration reforms
- Maintained high fertility support
- Added strong immigration policies (0.8)
- Moderate increases in regional development and work-life balance
- Goal: Layer in migration after fertility framework established

Phase 3 (2030+): Complete reform package
- High intensity (0.7-0.9) across all policy dimensions
- Comprehensive integration of all intervention types
- Goal: Full-spectrum demographic support system

Results show this phased approach was the most effective strategy tested:

1. Superior Outcomes: Achieved 17.6% improvement vs baseline, better than both early intervention (14.9%) and delayed intervention (7.9%)
2. Population Preservation: Final population of 98.4M, saving 14.7M people vs baseline
3. Structural Improvement: Lowest aging ratio (96.1%) and dependency ratio (2833) of any scenario
4. Implementation Benefits: Phasing allowed institutional learning and public adaptation while maintaining urgency

The success of this approach suggests that careful sequencing of policies, starting immediately but building complexity over time, may be more effective than either an all-at-once shock or a delayed comprehensive intervention.
