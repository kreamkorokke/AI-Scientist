        "Experiment": "We formulate Japan's population crisis as a multi-objective optimization problem balancing three critical dimensions: (1) reversing population decline (target: positive growth by 2040), (2) maintaining economic sustainability (dependency ratio <80), and (3) preserving social equity (regional population balance). Using mathematical Leslie matrix projections, we systematically explore the 10-dimensional policy space to identify Pareto-optimal intervention combinations. We test breakthrough scenarios including 'demographic moonshot' policies (e.g., universal childcare + 50% immigration increase + rural revitalization) against conventional incremental approaches. The experiment validates which policy combinations can realistically achieve population stabilization while quantifying trade-offs between economic costs and demographic benefits.",

        "Experiment": "Japan faces a rapidly closing window for demographic intervention before population decline becomes irreversible. We use mathematical population models to identify critical intervention windows where policy timing dramatically affects long-term outcomes. We test the hypothesis that 'emergency demographic protocols' implemented within the next 5-10 years could prevent catastrophic population collapse, while delayed interventions (post-2030) may be insufficient regardless of intensity. Using cohort-component projections, we simulate time-sensitive policy sequences (e.g., immediate fertility incentives \u2192 targeted immigration \u2192 sustained support) and compare early vs. late intervention scenarios. The experiment quantifies the demographic and economic costs of policy delay, providing evidence for urgent vs. gradual response strategies.",

        "Experiment": "With Japan's unprecedented 30% elderly population, we explore novel cross-generational policy designs that simultaneously address the needs of shrinking youth cohorts and expanding elderly populations. We develop age-structured policy models where interventions target multiple generations simultaneously (e.g., 'three-generation housing incentives', 'elder-to-youth skill transfer programs', 'intergenerational economic partnerships'). Using Leslie matrix analysis, we test whether cross-generational approaches can achieve superior demographic outcomes compared to age-segregated policies. We compare conventional single-target policies (youth fertility support OR elder care) against integrated multi-generational interventions, measuring population stabilization, economic efficiency, and social cohesion outcomes over 50-year projections.",

Using the existing stochastic framework, we simulate how policy interventions affect these interconnected populations through: (1) Different baseline fertility/mortality rates for urban/rural areas, (2) Internal migration flows between regions, (3) Region-specific policy effectiveness coefficients. We test whether targeted urban vs. rural policy packages produce different national-level outcomes, and examine how urban-rural migration patterns influence policy effectiveness. The experiment quantifies which intervention strategies best address Japan's geographically uneven demographic decline, while accounting for urban-rural interdependencies in population dynamics.",

Each shock is tested at fixed timepoints (2030, 2040) across all policy combinations. For each intervention package, we calculate three resilience metrics: population recovery time, maximum trajectory deviation, and cumulative population loss. Using these quantitative measures, we identify which policy combinations provide the best balance of effectiveness and resilience. The experiment demonstrates how different intervention strategies perform under stress conditions and provides concrete recommendations for crisis-robust demographic policy design.",

For each key pair, we implement three synergy levels (none, moderate, strong) in the demographic rate calculations. We then simulate 20-year trajectories for individual policies vs paired interventions, calculating the synergy multiplier (actual_combined_effect / sum_of_individual_effects). The experiment focuses on identifying which policy combinations deliver more than 120% of their individual effects when implemented together, providing concrete guidance for cost-effective intervention package design. We validate results using sensitivity analysis on synergy parameters.",

The CAF (ranging 1.0-2.0x) amplifies policy effects based on community implementation strength. Using the existing stochastic framework, we simulate each policy scenario under three community conditions: weak (CAF=1.0), moderate (CAF=1.5), and strong (CAF=2.0) social networks. We focus on policies most likely to benefit from social spreading (work-life balance, childcare, housing) and quantify the additional demographic impact achieved through community-level implementation.

Using the stochastic Leslie framework, we systematically test different orderings of our 10 policies across these schedules. We focus on two key questions: (1) Which policies must be implemented early vs can be delayed without significant impact loss? (2) What implementation speed is optimal for each policy type? For each sequence, we calculate both total demographic impact and year-by-year transition feasibility. The experiment provides concrete guidance on policy rollout strategy while maintaining computational and analytical tractability.",
