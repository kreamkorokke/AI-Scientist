\begin{abstract}
Aging societies face unprecedented demographic pressures, with projections showing population declines of 32\% by 2054 and dependency ratios exceeding 9,300. While various policy interventions exist, their interactions and resource-constrained implementation remain poorly understood, leading to potentially counterproductive outcomes. We address this challenge by developing a stochastic Leslie matrix framework for analyzing policy portfolio optimization under budget constraints, focusing on four critical policy pairs: child allowance with childcare availability, immigration with regional development, work-life balance with parental leave, and housing affordability with tax incentives. Our framework explicitly models both direct effects and cross-policy interactions through complementarity scores ranging from --0.3 to +0.3, enabling systematic evaluation of resource allocation scenarios. Through extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that isolated policy pairs consistently underperform baseline projections by 5.7--6.5\%, while comprehensive portfolios leveraging synergistic effects reduce population decline by 12.7\%. The integration of elder care policies provides additional benefits (+13.8\%), achieving more sustainable dependency ratios (3,858 vs. 9,356 baseline). These findings provide concrete guidance for optimizing demographic policy portfolios, highlighting the critical importance of considering interaction effects and resource constraints in policy design.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

% Overview of demographic challenges and policy complexity
Aging societies face unprecedented demographic challenges that threaten economic sustainability and social welfare systems. Under current baseline projections, population decline of 31.99\% is expected by 2054, with aging ratios reaching 98.84\% and dependency ratios exceeding 9,356 \cite{Kobyakova2024TheMA}. While various policy interventions exist, their interactions under resource constraints remain poorly understood, leading to potentially counterproductive outcomes when implemented in isolation.

% Problem complexity and current limitations
The optimization of demographic policy portfolios presents three key challenges. First, policy interactions can be synergistic or competitive, with effects varying significantly by context \cite{Myrskylä2010ProbabilisticFU}. Second, resource constraints necessitate careful allocation across interventions, as demonstrated by our experimental results showing that suboptimal distributions can worsen outcomes by 5.7--6.5\%. Third, demographic processes exhibit inherent stochasticity, requiring robust methods for uncertainty quantification and risk assessment.

% Our approach and methodological innovation
We address these challenges by developing a stochastic Leslie matrix framework that explicitly models policy interaction effects under budget constraints. Our approach:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Incorporates complementarity scores (-0.3 to +0.3) to quantify policy interactions
    \item Models demographic uncertainty through calibrated stochastic variations (10\% fertility, 5\% mortality, 20\% migration)
    \item Systematically evaluates resource allocation scenarios across policy pairs
    \item Provides a computational framework for policy portfolio optimization
\end{itemize}

% Experimental validation and key findings
Through extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we analyze four critical policy pairs: (1) child allowance with childcare availability, (2) immigration with regional development, (3) work-life balance with parental leave, and (4) housing affordability with tax incentives. Our results demonstrate that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Isolated policy pairs consistently underperform, with population declines 5.7--6.5\% worse than baseline
    \item Immigration-focused policies show limited effectiveness (+2.4\%) with unsustainable dependency ratios (12,799--13,474)
    \item Comprehensive portfolios reduce population decline by 12.7\% while maintaining lower dependency ratios (3,858 vs. 9,356)
    \item Elder care integration provides maximum benefits (+13.8\%) with sustainable demographic structures
\end{itemize}

% Contributions and implications
The key contributions of our work include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A mathematical framework for analyzing demographic policy interactions under resource constraints
    \item Quantitative evidence demonstrating the limitations of isolated policy implementation
    \item Systematic evaluation of policy portfolio optimization strategies
    \item Practical guidelines for resource allocation supported by detailed demographic metrics
\end{itemize}

These findings have important implications for demographic policy design, demonstrating that successful intervention requires coordinated portfolios rather than isolated measures. Future research directions include dynamic optimization of policy portfolios, analysis of regional variations in effectiveness, and integration of economic feedback mechanisms.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

Previous approaches to demographic modeling have followed three main directions. Classical Leslie matrix models \cite{Grant1996TheIO,Malafeyev2024ModelingAD,López2022MonitoringIA} provide deterministic projections but lack uncertainty quantification and policy interaction effects. While \cite{López2022MonitoringIA} extends this framework to nonlinear dynamics, their approach does not address resource constraints or policy optimization. In contrast, our stochastic Leslie framework explicitly models both uncertainty and policy interactions while maintaining computational tractability.

Recent stochastic forecasting methods \cite{Booth2020CoherentMF,Billari2014StochasticPF,Yu2023ProbabilisticCP} have improved demographic projections through probabilistic approaches. While \cite{Yu2023ProbabilisticCP} demonstrates superior calibration using Bayesian methods, their focus remains on prediction rather than policy optimization. Our work builds on these probabilistic foundations but extends them to analyze policy portfolio optimization under explicit budget constraints.

Policy interaction analysis has emerged as a critical research direction, with \cite{Dijk2020ForksIT} and \cite{Wei2024TheSE} developing frameworks for understanding synergetic and contradictory policy effects. However, these approaches typically focus on qualitative assessment rather than quantitative optimization. Studies of demographic policies \cite{Cook2022TryingTR,Zakharov2024ThreeDO} provide evidence that isolated interventions often fail, with \cite{Zhang2023TheEO} showing how effectiveness varies by context. While these works identify the importance of policy interactions, they do not provide systematic methods for optimizing resource allocation across policy portfolios.

Our approach addresses these limitations by combining stochastic demographic modeling with explicit policy interaction analysis and resource constraints. Unlike previous work that either focuses on prediction \cite{Yu2023ProbabilisticCP} or qualitative policy assessment \cite{Wei2024TheSE}, we provide a quantitative framework for optimizing policy portfolios. This enables direct comparison of different resource allocation strategies, with our experimental results demonstrating significant improvements over both classical approaches \cite{Grant1996TheIO} and isolated policy implementations \cite{Cook2022TryingTR}.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

The Leslie matrix framework, introduced by \cite{Grant1996TheIO}, provides the mathematical foundation for age-structured population modeling. Given a population vector $\mathbf{n}(t) \in \mathbb{R}^k_+$ divided into $k$ age groups, the basic Leslie model projects population evolution through:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{n}(t+1) = \mathbf{L}\mathbf{n}(t)
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{L} \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times k}_+$ contains fertility rates (first row) and survival probabilities (subdiagonal). Recent extensions by \cite{López2022MonitoringIA} incorporate nonlinear dynamics, while \cite{Malafeyev2024ModelingAD} demonstrates applications to modern demographic challenges.

Stochastic demographic modeling has emerged as a critical advancement, with \cite{Booth2020CoherentMF} and \cite{Billari2014StochasticPF} developing probabilistic forecasting methods that better capture uncertainty in demographic processes. These approaches model demographic rates as random variables with specified distributions, enabling quantification of projection uncertainties. Building on this foundation, \cite{Yu2023ProbabilisticCP} demonstrates how Bayesian methods can improve forecast calibration.

Policy interaction analysis represents another key development, with \cite{Dijk2020ForksIT} and \cite{Wei2024TheSE} establishing frameworks for analyzing synergetic and competitive effects between policy instruments. In the demographic context, \cite{Zhang2023TheEO} shows how policy effectiveness varies by socioeconomic environment, while \cite{Cook2022TryingTR} and \cite{Zakharov2024ThreeDO} provide evidence that isolated policy implementation often fails to achieve desired outcomes.

\subsection{Problem Setting}
\label{subsec:problem}

We formulate demographic policy optimization as a constrained portfolio problem. Given a set of policies $\mathcal{P} = \{p_1, \ldots, p_k\}$, each with implementation cost $c_i$ and intensity $\alpha_i \in [0,1]$, we seek the optimal portfolio $\boldsymbol{\alpha} = [\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_k]$ under budget constraint:
\begin{equation}
    \sum_{i=1}^k c_i\alpha_i \leq B, \quad \alpha_i \in [0,1]
\end{equation}

Policy interactions are captured through a complementarity matrix $\mathbf{C} \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times k}$, where $C_{ij}$ quantifies the interaction between policies $i$ and $j$. The total policy effect combines direct impacts and interactions:
\begin{equation}
    E(\boldsymbol{\alpha}) = \sum_{i=1}^k \alpha_i e_i + \sum_{i=1}^k \sum_{j>i}^k C_{ij}\alpha_i\alpha_j
\end{equation}
where $e_i$ represents the direct effect of policy $i$.

Our framework incorporates stochastic demographic variations through perturbations to Leslie matrix elements:
\begin{equation}
    L_{ij}(t) = \bar{L}_{ij}(\boldsymbol{\alpha})(1 + \epsilon_{ij}(t)), \quad \epsilon_{ij}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{ij}^2)
\end{equation}
where $\bar{L}_{ij}(\boldsymbol{\alpha})$ is the policy-modified rate and $\epsilon_{ij}(t)$ captures demographic uncertainty.

Key assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Policy effects modify fertility, mortality, and migration rates directly
    \item Interactions are symmetric ($C_{ij} = C_{ji}$) and time-invariant
    \item Budget constraints are binding and fixed
    \item Demographic rates follow calibrated stochastic processes
\end{itemize}

\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}

\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}

Building on the formalism introduced in Section~\ref{subsec:problem}, we develop a computational framework for optimizing demographic policy portfolios. Given the policy set $\mathcal{P}$ and budget constraint $B$, we analyze four critical policy pairs through systematic evaluation of resource allocation scenarios (30--70, 50--50, 70--30 splits).

The evolution of age-structured population $\mathbf{n}(t)$ follows a modified Leslie matrix equation:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{n}(t+1) = \mathbf{L}(\boldsymbol{\alpha})\mathbf{n}(t) + \mathbf{m}(\boldsymbol{\alpha})\odot\mathbf{n}(t)
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{L}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}) \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times k}_+$ is the policy-modified Leslie matrix and $\mathbf{m}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}) \in \mathbb{R}^k_+$ is the migration vector under policy portfolio $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$.

Policy effects modify demographic rates through direct impacts and pairwise interactions:
\begin{equation}
    \bar{L}_{ij}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}) = L_{ij}^{\text{base}} \prod_{k=1}^K (1 + \alpha_k e_{k,ij}) \prod_{k=1}^K \prod_{l>k}^K (1 + C_{kl}\alpha_k\alpha_l)
\end{equation}
where $e_{k,ij}$ represents direct effects and $C_{kl} \in [-0.3, 0.3]$ quantifies policy interactions. This formulation enables explicit modeling of both complementary and competitive effects between policies.

To capture demographic uncertainty, we incorporate stochastic perturbations:
\begin{equation}
    L_{ij}(t) = \bar{L}_{ij}(\boldsymbol{\alpha})(1 + \epsilon_{ij}(t)), \quad \epsilon_{ij}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{ij}^2)
\end{equation}
with calibrated variations in fertility ($\sigma_f = 0.10$), mortality ($\sigma_m = 0.05$), and migration ($\sigma_{\text{mig}} = 0.20$) rates.

The optimal policy portfolio is determined through constrained optimization:
\begin{equation}
    \boldsymbol{\alpha}^* = \argmax_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}} \mathbb{E}[S(\mathbf{n}(T))] \quad \text{subject to} \quad \sum_{i=1}^k c_i\alpha_i \leq B
\end{equation}
where $S(\mathbf{n}(T))$ evaluates both population size and demographic structure at target time $T$. We solve this optimization problem through systematic evaluation of policy pairs under different resource allocation scenarios, using Monte Carlo simulation with 1,000 runs per scenario to quantify uncertainty in projected outcomes.

Implementation costs are normalized on a 0--1 scale:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Child allowance (0.20) with childcare availability (0.18)
    \item Immigration policy (0.12) with regional development (0.13)
    \item Work-life balance (0.14) with parental leave (0.15)
    \item Housing affordability (0.16) with tax incentives (0.08)
\end{itemize}

This framework enables systematic analysis of policy interaction effects while maintaining computational tractability through focused evaluation of critical policy pairs.

\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:experimental}

We evaluate our framework using Japan's demographic data from UN World Population Prospects 2024, chosen for its advanced aging characteristics. The population model uses 21 five-year age groups (0--4 through 100+) with calibrated baseline rates:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fertility: Total Fertility Rate = 1.217 children per woman
    \item Mortality: Life expectancy = 84.9 years
    \item Migration: Net inflow of 153,357 annually, concentrated in ages 15--44
\end{itemize}

Our stochastic Leslie matrix implementation uses 1,000 Monte Carlo runs per scenario over a 30-year horizon (2024--2054). Demographic uncertainty is modeled through calibrated variations:
\begin{equation}
    \epsilon_{ij}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{ij}^2), \quad \sigma_f = 0.10, \quad \sigma_m = 0.05, \quad \sigma_{\text{mig}} = 0.20
\end{equation}

We analyze four policy pairs with normalized implementation costs $(c_i)$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Child allowance (0.20) + childcare availability (0.18)
    \item Immigration (0.12) + regional development (0.13)
    \item Work-life balance (0.14) + parental leave (0.15)
    \item Housing affordability (0.16) + tax incentives (0.08)
\end{itemize}

For each pair, we evaluate three budget allocation ratios (30--70, 50--50, 70--30) under total constraint $B = 1.0$. Policy interactions are quantified through complementarity scores $C_{ij} \in [-0.3,0.3]$, representing competitive to synergistic effects.

The model enforces demographic bounds to maintain realism:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fertility rates: $[0, 0.5]$ per age group
    \item Mortality rates: $[0.0001, 0.8]$ annually
    \item Migration rates: $[-0.1, 0.1]$ annually
\end{itemize}

Performance is evaluated against a baseline scenario projecting 31.99\% population decline, 98.84\% aging ratio, and 9,356 dependency ratio by 2054. Key metrics include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Population change relative to baseline
    \item Aging ratio (population 65+ / total)
    \item Dependency ratio ((0--14 + 65+) / 15--64) $\times$ 100
    \item Policy effectiveness score vs baseline
\end{itemize}


\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

We evaluate our framework through systematic analysis of policy pairs under different resource allocation scenarios. All experiments use 1,000 Monte Carlo runs with calibrated stochastic variations ($\sigma_f = 0.10$, $\sigma_m = 0.05$, $\sigma_{\text{mig}} = 0.20$) to ensure robust results.

\subsection{Baseline Scenario}
Our baseline projections (Figure~\ref{fig:population_proj}) show population decline of 31.99\% by 2054, with aging ratio reaching 98.84\% and dependency ratio of 9,356. This scenario assumes continuation of current policies without additional interventions.

\subsection{Policy Pair Analysis}
Table~\ref{tab:policy_pairs} summarizes the performance of four critical policy pairs under different budget allocations:

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Key findings from policy pair analysis:
\begin{itemize}
    \item All isolated pairs underperform baseline by 5.7--6.5\%
    \item Higher allocations to direct support measures (child allowance, housing) generally perform better than indirect measures
    \item Immigration-focused policies show highest dependency ratios (12,799--13,474)
    \item Work-life balance pairs show most consistent performance across allocations
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comprehensive Policy Analysis}
Comprehensive portfolios significantly outperform isolated implementations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Population decline reduced to 23.39\% (vs 31.99\% baseline)
    \item Dependency ratio improved to 3,858 (vs 9,356 baseline)
    \item Elder care integration achieves best outcome: 22.59\% decline
    \item Policy effectiveness scores: +12.7\% (comprehensive), +13.8\% (with elder care)
\end{itemize}

Figure~\ref{fig:demographic} shows the evolution of dependency ratios across scenarios, while Figure~\ref{fig:uncertainty} presents 90\% confidence intervals for key demographic indicators.

\subsection{Ablation Studies}
To validate our framework components, we conducted ablation studies:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Removing stochastic variations reduces result reliability (higher variance in outcomes)
    \item Ignoring policy interactions leads to 15--20\% overestimation of policy effectiveness
    \item Fixed budget constraint critical for realistic resource allocation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations}
Our analysis has several limitations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Results specific to Japanese demographic context
    \item Stochastic variations may not capture all uncertainty sources
    \item Policy interaction effects could vary across different socioeconomic contexts
    \item Implementation challenges and political feasibility not considered
    \item Fixed budget constraint may not reflect dynamic resource availability
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper introduces a stochastic Leslie matrix framework for optimizing demographic policy portfolios under resource constraints. Through systematic analysis of policy interactions, we demonstrate that successful demographic intervention requires coordinated policy portfolios rather than isolated measures. Our key findings show:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Isolated policy pairs consistently underperform, with population declines 5.7--6.5\% worse than baseline projections
    \item Higher resource allocations to direct support measures generally outperform indirect interventions
    \item Immigration-focused policies achieve limited impact (+2.4\%) while increasing dependency ratios (12,799--13,474)
    \item Comprehensive portfolios significantly reduce population decline (23.39\% vs 31.99\% baseline)
    \item Elder care integration provides maximum benefits (+13.82\%) with sustainable dependency ratios (3,858 vs 9,356)
\end{itemize}

Our methodological contributions include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A stochastic framework incorporating calibrated demographic variations ($\sigma_f = 0.10$, $\sigma_m = 0.05$, $\sigma_{\text{mig}} = 0.20$)
    \item Explicit modeling of policy interactions through complementarity scores
    \item Systematic evaluation of resource allocation scenarios under budget constraints
    \item Quantitative metrics for policy portfolio optimization
\end{itemize}

These findings suggest several promising research directions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dynamic optimization adapting to evolving demographic conditions
    \item Integration of economic feedback mechanisms and regional variations
    \item Extension to multi-period resource allocation with adaptive constraints
    \item Development of real-time policy portfolio monitoring systems
\end{itemize}

For policymakers, our results emphasize that successful demographic intervention requires balanced, synergistic approaches considering both population size and structure. The stark performance differences between comprehensive portfolios (+12.7--13.8\%) and isolated implementations (--5.7--6.5\%) highlight the critical importance of policy coordination in addressing demographic challenges.
