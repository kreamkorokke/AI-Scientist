# Title: Cross-Generational Policy Architecture for Ultra-Aging Society Management
# Experiment description: With Japan's unprecedented 30% elderly population, we explore novel cross-generational policy designs that simultaneously address the needs of shrinking youth cohorts and expanding elderly populations. We develop age-structured policy models where interventions target multiple generations simultaneously (e.g., 'three-generation housing incentives', 'elder-to-youth skill transfer programs', 'intergenerational economic partnerships'). Using Leslie matrix analysis, we test whether cross-generational approaches can achieve superior demographic outcomes compared to age-segregated policies. We compare conventional single-target policies (youth fertility support OR elder care) against integrated multi-generational interventions, measuring population stabilization, economic efficiency, and social cohesion outcomes over 50-year projections.

Description: Implemented three-generation housing policy with enhanced effects on housing affordability, elder care, and cross-generational support. Key findings:
1. Most effective policy tested so far with 20.38% improvement vs baseline
2. Reduced population decline to -17.32% (vs -31.32% baseline)
3. Lowered aging ratio to 96.98% (vs 98.82% baseline)
4. Significantly improved dependency ratio to 3,628 (vs 9,175 baseline)
5. Achieved highest final population of 101.78M (vs 84.55M baseline)
Analysis: The three-generation housing policy shows remarkable effectiveness by creating physical and social infrastructure for intergenerational support. The policy's success appears to stem from its holistic approach - simultaneously addressing fertility through housing affordability, elder care through proximity, and social cohesion through shared living spaces. This suggests that policies promoting direct intergenerational interaction may be more effective than separate interventions for different age groups.

## Run 2: Intergenerational Skill Transfer Program
Results: {'baseline_population_decline_pct': -31.29744429561247, 'baseline_aging_ratio_pct': 98.82335160595382, 'baseline_dependency_ratio': 9199.539651548494, 'baseline_policy_effectiveness_pct': 0.0, 'baseline_final_population_millions': 84.5752362340142, 'skill_transfer_population_decline_pct': -19.639763577465498, 'skill_transfer_aging_ratio_pct': 97.2650818330007, 'skill_transfer_dependency_ratio': 3998.828291421646, 'skill_transfer_policy_effectiveness_pct': 16.968336328429313, 'skill_transfer_final_population_millions': 98.92624676876534, 'three_gen_housing_population_decline_pct': -17.284833041946072, 'three_gen_housing_aging_ratio_pct': 96.96374951135616, 'three_gen_housing_dependency_ratio': 3609.308025988855, 'three_gen_housing_policy_effectiveness_pct': 20.39605529954327, 'three_gen_housing_final_population_millions': 101.82524818602309}
Description: Implemented intergenerational skill transfer program focusing on knowledge exchange between elderly and younger generations. Key findings:
1. Second most effective policy with 16.97% improvement vs baseline
2. Reduced population decline to -19.64% (vs -31.30% baseline)
3. Improved aging ratio to 97.27% (vs 98.82% baseline)
4. Significantly improved dependency ratio to 3,999 (vs 9,200 baseline)
5. Achieved final population of 98.93M (vs 84.58M baseline)
Analysis: The skill transfer program demonstrates strong effectiveness through several mechanisms:
1. Enhanced productivity and economic participation through mentoring
2. Improved work integration and career development for younger generations
3. Maintained elderly engagement in workforce and society
4. Created valuable social connections across generations
The results suggest that formalized knowledge transfer between generations can significantly impact both demographic and economic outcomes. While not quite as effective as the three-generation housing policy, it provides complementary benefits and could potentially be combined for even stronger effects.

## Run 3: Intergenerational Economic Partnerships
Results: {'baseline_population_decline_pct': -31.108768820384235, 'baseline_aging_ratio_pct': 98.76926494511487, 'baseline_dependency_ratio': 8801.085872706404, 'baseline_policy_effectiveness_pct': 0.0, 'baseline_final_population_millions': 84.80750230803994, 'economic_partnership_population_decline_pct': -14.624852810960926, 'economic_partnership_aging_ratio_pct': 96.20707714803153, 'economic_partnership_dependency_ratio': 2888.5403118985137, 'economic_partnership_policy_effectiveness_pct': 23.92745161782032, 'economic_partnership_final_population_millions': 105.09977639107805}
Description: Implemented intergenerational economic partnerships focusing on financial incentives for cross-generational business cooperation. Key findings:
1. Most effective policy tested with 23.93% improvement vs baseline
2. Dramatically reduced population decline to -14.62% (vs -31.11% baseline)
3. Achieved lowest aging ratio at 96.21% (vs 98.77% baseline)
4. Best dependency ratio at 2,889 (vs 8,801 baseline)
5. Highest final population of 105.10M (vs 84.81M baseline)
Analysis: The economic partnership policy shows exceptional effectiveness through multiple channels:
1. Created sustainable economic incentives for intergenerational cooperation
2. Enhanced labor force participation across all age groups
3. Improved financial stability for both young and elderly populations
4. Generated positive feedback loops between economic and demographic outcomes
The results demonstrate that economic partnerships between generations can create powerful synergies, outperforming even the successful housing and skill transfer programs. The policy's success suggests that economic incentives can effectively catalyze and reinforce social connections between generations.

## Run 4: Integrated Cross-Generational Approach
Results: {'baseline_population_decline_pct': -31.12733304634242, 'baseline_aging_ratio_pct': 98.76978331078465, 'baseline_dependency_ratio': 8804.754263236817, 'baseline_policy_effectiveness_pct': 0.0, 'baseline_final_population_millions': 84.78464910003599, 'integrated_approach_population_decline_pct': -6.535222922170057, 'integrated_approach_aging_ratio_pct': 94.10233608696372, 'integrated_approach_dependency_ratio': 1856.702898966716, 'integrated_approach_policy_effectiveness_pct': 35.70663256109957, 'integrated_approach_final_population_millions': 115.05839222240346}
Description: Implemented comprehensive integration of successful cross-generational policies (housing, skill transfer, and economic partnerships) with enhanced synergistic effects. Key findings:
1. Most effective policy by far with 35.71% improvement vs baseline
2. Dramatically reduced population decline to -6.54% (vs -31.13% baseline)
3. Achieved best aging ratio at 94.10% (vs 98.77% baseline)
4. Best dependency ratio at 1,857 (vs 8,805 baseline)
5. Highest final population of 115.06M (vs 84.78M baseline)
Analysis: The integrated approach demonstrates powerful synergistic effects through multiple mechanisms:
1. Combined physical proximity (housing) with economic incentives and skill transfer
2. Created mutually reinforcing feedback loops between different policy components
3. Addressed demographic challenges simultaneously across multiple dimensions
4. Generated stronger social and economic connections between generations
The results strongly support the hypothesis that integrated cross-generational policies can achieve superior outcomes compared to single-focus or age-segregated approaches. The dramatic improvement in all key metrics suggests that policy synergies can help overcome demographic challenges more effectively than the sum of individual interventions.
